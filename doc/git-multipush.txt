NAME
       git-multipush - push a branch to multiple remotes in one command.

SYNOPSIS
       git multipush [OPTIONS] [<remote>...] [-- GIT_OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Particularly useful for people hosting on multiple git repo providers
       all at once. e.g., github.com, gitorious.org and repo.or.cz.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Print the git commands before executing them.

       -e, --error
           Fail immediately when any push fails. Otherwise, we fail after all
           pushes with the error code of the last failed push.

       -n, --dry-run
           Donâ€™t run any of the git commands. Only print them, as in -v.

           The branch to push. If none given, none are passed on to git push.

       --version
           Print version info in the format git multipush version $version.

       <remote>...
           The list of remotes to push to. None passed to git push if none
           given.

       GIT_OPTIONS
           Options passed directly on to git push.
